# Landing Pages

Just a quick mockup of a landing page suited for converting prospects to CTD promotions.

### Components

For the landing page I've incorporated five separate components:

* Branding
* Messaging
* Product
* Social Proof
* Call To Action

#### 1. Branding

The branding is rather simple and clear consisting of the CTD logo displayed at the top of the page. The logo should be linked back to http://coconuttreedivers.com. The social media buttons could be pared down a bit to only include Facebook and Twitter or other primary sources of content that would be in context with what you are promoting.

#### 2. Messaging

The messaging consists of a simple tagline to get the user's attention with a message of promise towards what CTD will do for them.

Directly below is brief descriptive text explaining what CTD is and what type of services are offered. Links to other parts of the site (blog, courses, crew would be appropriate).

#### 3. Product

What better description than to let the product speak for itself? All images linked back to blog, photo albums, etc. Keep in mind that some people will not have access to walled applications like Facebook or simply do not have an account, so a service like Imgur.com that provides free, public image hosting could be employed in these circumstances to host curated albums relevant to the promotion.

In this case I used some images that describe the type of sea life a diver would encounter on a dive, photos of divers enjoying themselves and a photo of the crew. It's not visible but follows a pattern of "Who, What, When, Where and How."

#### 4. Social Proof

While "as featured in" pieces are sort of lazy, they do provide the user with almost instantaneous recognition of the value that the product has in the marketplace. In this case you could use Padi and Trip Advisor while RMP may not be as relevant. Those logos would link back to content on the third-party site relevant to CTD or the promotion offered.

This social proof is reinforced by personal testimonials from other users. I used a generic review from Trip Advisor that has a photo, tag line and descriptive testimonial. It should be linked back to the CTD testimonials on Trip Advisor

#### 5. Call to action

The call to action is highly-visible, unambigious and centered in the user's line-of-sight. In this case it's a link to a sign-up page. In an even simpler incarnation it could be just a form to collect their email address to commence an engagement relationship or a phone number to CTD that would be automatically activated on a smartphone.
